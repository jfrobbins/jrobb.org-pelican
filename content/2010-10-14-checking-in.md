Not too much has been going on lately.  Well...we had a kid! On October 2nd: our third, a girl named Anastasia.  So we have been busy with that.  I have done a little with the jeep...but not much: Mostly I am still just amassing parts still.  I am also trying to decide between running a 220v line in the house and getting a bigger welder, vs getting a generator vs getting a welder/generator combo.  decisions...

 I got some 17" wheels (H2 wheels), some hubs for my rear axle that I haven't picked up yet, and in the next week or so I need to actually pick up said axle.  Here are the wheels:

Also, I have lowered the price on my bike to reflect the wreck damage, however there has not been much interest.  I also recently realized that the radiator is not sealing properly.  SO I ordered a new (to me) radiator yesterday for $100, and some new frame slidersr $35. I figure I can fix the things as I go along.  All that is left is the rear brake pedal, and the gas tank dents.  I may bondo and paint the tank.  And the scratching on the front brake lever and master cylinder I think I can buff out.  After all of that, the damage will pretty much be isolated to the exhaust, which isn't too bad in the scheme of things.  If I don't sell it in the next week or two before winter sets in, I'm going to park it and try to re-sell in the spring!
