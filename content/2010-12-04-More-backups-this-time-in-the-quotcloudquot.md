My wife was very concerned about the viability of our photos and things in the event of a house fire, or theft, or some other horrible event.  I have an existing backup solution in-home, which would suffice for a drive failure or anything like that.  What we have been lacking is an off-site backup, and after looking around at several options, I settled on <a title="JungleDisk" href="https://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">JungleDisk</a>.  This service offers automated backups, directory syncing, and the ability to encrypt the disk and files.  AND it works with Linux!

 My in-house backup basically consists of using rsync to mirror directories across 3 drives.  pretty simple stuff.

 This online service starts at $3 per month, and then after the first 5GB,it is $0.15 per GB.  Not very bad, however we have TONS of data to back up--probably 50GB, pictures that date back to 2006 and earlier.  Because of this, I think what I will do is burn all of the older data to DVD (or possibly blu ray), and store these discs off-site, and then use JungleDisk to only backup the current year.  Once the year is completed, I will burn it to disc, and then start online backup on the following year.  So we will see how this works out, I guess!
