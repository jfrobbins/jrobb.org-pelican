I found this interesting, even though this is kind of an old video, by [Evan Prodromou](https://identi.ca/evan) from fosdem back in 2010.
Especially interesting is the DB structure, I've also found pure normalized tables to be very slow-- even though that is what they teach you in school.

Also, PHP.  It used to be awesome, and "the thing", but that's now being more replaced with javascript and stuff that works much better--which is certainly a good thing.  I've very excited to see what happens with [pump.io](http://pump.io/).
