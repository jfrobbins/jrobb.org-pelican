Yesterday morning I jacked up the front and started by removing the front driveshaft, whatever brake lines and things were still connected, shocks, tie rod, etc.  Before I did all that, though, I did have the sense to go ahead and unbolt the passenger side hub and pop it out so I can easily remove the axleshaft later if I need to use it or remove the locker.

 After all of that was completed, which took quite a while (thank God for air tools!), I began to unbolt the ubolts which hold the axle down onto the springs.  This was  a problem--angle grinder + cutoff wheel to the rescue!  I cut those bad boys off, and then unbolted the springs from the shackles and dropped all of that crap.

 Now, my front springs are removed and my POS axle is laying there on the ground.  Next, I will have to do the same for the rear.  A guy is coming one day this week to buy my springs from me, which will work nicely towards Phase 2 for me.  Also, I may be picking up a new axle today...or just one day this week since it looks like it may rain all day today.

 Phase 1:

 <ul>
<li>33" tires</li>
<li>3.5" lift springs</li>
<li>lockers front/rear</li>
<li>trimmed fenders/TJ flares</li>
<li>0.75" lift boomerang shackles</li>
<li>4.10 gears</li>
</ul>
Phase 2:

 <ul>
<li>35" (or 36 ...36.5") tires</li>
<li>1.5" or 2" lift springs</li>
<li>same trimmed fenders and shackles</li>
<li>4.88 gearing</li>
<li>SOA (Spring Over Axle)</li>
<li>as part of SOA: high steer, traction bars, resized driveshaft(s), new spring perches and U-bolts</li>
<li>optional: chromoly shafs (super88 and d30), selectable locker in front, detroit in rear</li>
</ul>
