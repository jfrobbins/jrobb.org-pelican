So I'd [written before](/2013/08/01/raspberry-pi-pump-server/) and even did an [HPR episode](http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1338) with [@nybill](http://sn.gunmonkeynet.net/index.php/nybill) about the Raspberry Pi that I was using as a [pump.io](http://pump.io) server.
It was running well, aside from being a little bit slow--and I did have a few reservations about memory consumption, which I had planned to "fix" by splitting the database serving portion of it over to a beaglebone black.  

Around the time I was planning to do this, however, I started having some network problems at home and now most of my ports are blocked so the pi could no longer work as a social media server.
I'm still having these problems, and haven't worked out a way around it yet, so I decided to go ahead and shut it down.

Since then, I've used my [backup account](https://microca.st/jrobb), and then most recently migrated back into using [my server that runs on my VPS](https://io.jrobb.org/jrobb).
That's about where I am now, and aside from life getting busy and not being on the computer much lately, that's pretty much the extent of what's going on.
