So, apparently there<b> is</b> a backup of the website.&nbsp; However the [(free) webhost](http://www.x10hosting.com/) has to re-create my account and set everything back up.

I really can't complain, I mean...it is a FREE host.&nbsp; However, lately the outages have been really common, and then now this complete deletion of my account.&nbsp; pretty crazy.

I think that I will stick with this (blogger), being it is still free, and the uptime is MUCH better.&nbsp; Also, since I'm not really doing a lot of custom type design or site layout type of stuff, it doesn't really matter.&nbsp; I don't need a custom host to do the types of things I am doing.&nbsp; The old factorQ archive was neat to have up and running, to be able to read through, and I may enable that again, witha&nbsp; link or something.

I just think blogger is all good for now.
That in combination with the [forums](http://fqforums.co.cc/) (which are run on [yuku](http://www.yuku.com/)) make a pretty sweet setup.&nbsp; Especially given the amount of traffic I experience on a day to day basis...which is very little.
