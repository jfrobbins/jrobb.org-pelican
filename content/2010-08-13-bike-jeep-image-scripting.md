Summary: I've put my bike up for sale...the ad/info/pictures are here:  [jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/](http://jrob.co.cc/forsale/2005sv650/" target="_blank).  Ideally this will sell so I can use the funds to fix my jeep in a more timely manner.  Although I did have a pretty sweet deal worked out for a Dana 60 front and Dana 70u rear, it didn't really appear that would work out--the front was PSD, and I need DSD (without significantly more work/money).  So, it looks like I am going to be going with a Dana 44 front / Ford 9" rear as long as we can work something out with pricing.

 Oh, I'm now on the [Linux Outlaws Planet](http://outlawpla.net)! sweet.  I forgot to copy my hackergotchi image over after my webhost crashed, so I'll have to update that.

 Along with some help from [@psquid](http://identi.ca/psquid) I got my AUR package update Bash script working --it can (almost) be run with cron at some regular interval on an Arch system, if they [heybuddy](http://launchpad.net/heybuddy) version from launchpad &gt; the AUR version, the PKGBUILD file is updated, and the taurball is created and uploaded to the AUR.

 To do the uploading, I am currently using [aurploader](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faur.archlinux.org%2Fpackages.php%3FID%3D23393&amp;ei=QS9lTNDDGcG78ganzcSzCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTq9-kXuB1NtaCRXO5hWo08XHsOg).  I am either going to modify this code to get it to work completly scriptable as I want ust fork it entirely.  This is the last bit of required human interaction required in this script.

 It isn't a very pretty script, and I really...<span style="text-decoration:underline;">really</span> don't know very much bash, but it seems to work like I want it to for something as simple as this is.  I will post it up, I think...maybe in my next post, hopefully by then I will have it all worked out!

 That's all I've got for now.
