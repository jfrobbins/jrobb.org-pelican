I've recently decided to move from [octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), 
mostly because I'm much more familiar with [Python](https://www.python.org/) than with Ruby.
This is good because if I want to hack the source a bit, I can do that much easier.

Otherwise, they are very similar -- they both run and generate static html from source files (in my case, markdown).

I created [this python script](https://gist.github.com/jfrobbins/b586b3a29fed71cb212b) to convert all of my existing posts into a pelican-friendly format.
While I was at it, I made a few small changes so that corrections could be made in some places from improper conversions of the past 
(I have gone from wordpress->hl--->jbs->octopress->pelican).

Overall I think it went well.  This post is actually my first for this new system.
I hardly ever blog anymore, mostly I stick to [pump.io](https://io.jrobb.org) but a blog is good to have for information sharing and documentation.

I still have some work to do with the [themes](http://pelicanthemes.com/) and finding one I like.

Anyway, first post. Time to get to work.
