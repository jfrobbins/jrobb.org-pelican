I did have [Jolicloud](http://www.jolicloud.com/" target="_blank) on my eeePC (900A), and it was fine for a while.  Actually, it was a pretty neat distro.  However when you try to install things using apt-get like a normal distro instead of through the "app cloud", some things stop working and it goes downhil.  This, combined with me itching to hop a couple of distros let me to switch.

 So I started out using [UNetBootin](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Funetbootin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;ei=mvY-TMfcPMGB8gbw3bWuCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFG2iJy14ueI6PKA0HBkn1cP-KoBg" target="_blank) to create a Live USB stick for [Fedora 13](http://distrowatch.com/fedora" target="_blank) (LXDE), and installed on the EEE.  The eee is actually pretty well supported with Fedora, including the wireless (on the 900 model that I have, the 1100+ may be a different story).  This was okay, except that it was not optimized for the small screen, and some of the GUI prompts actually hung off of the screen.  Not to mention I was missing some "tap and click" functionality of the trackpad thing.  Total time installed.... about 4 hours.

 From this point on...I had a bit of trouble.

 <!--more-->
I now realize that my problems had a LOT to do with the drives I was using, and drive order on boot, etc.  The main drive of my EEE is a 4GB SSD.  I also have a 2GB SD card in the reader, which I intended to use as /home.  and then, the USB media was another drive (when one was used).

 I have a cd-r with [CrunchBang](http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang" target="_blank) 10 Alpha 2 "Statler" (which I run on my other laptop), so since this release does not play nicely with live USB media, I hooked up my slim CD/DVD RW USB drive and booted the cd-r I had previously burned. Somehow, this got completely messed up and would not boot after install.  after trying to fix it for a bit, I gave up, and then I moved onto...

 [SLiTaz](http://distrowatch.com/slitaz" target="_blank).  This is a very small distro, about 30mb, which I ran from a USB stick.  On boot, it installs entirely into the RAM and is extremely quick.  This is much like Puppy Linux, however there is a root and standard user ([Puppy](http://distrowatch.com/puppy" target="_blank) only has root...or that was the case the last time I used it, anyway).  I installed this to the disk, using the same setup with /(root) /home and swap partitions between the SSD and SD card. This setup would almost boot, but no kernel found-- so I just edited the GRUB prompt and got it to boot no problem.  Then, however, I could not log in as my standard user!  I could log in as root, and change passwords and anything else-- I even removed and re-added my standard user, and still could not log in.

 At this point, I was even more frustrated.  I decided to try CrunchBang Statler ONE more time.  Hooked up the USB CD drive again and reinstalled.  However THIS time I just installed all to the SSD.  worked like a charm.  After the install was setup, I got the UUID for the SD card and modified my /etc/fstab to mount it as /home.  Voila!  Everything working like a champ.

 Also, in #! 10, the trackpad works terrifically!  Tap and click, along with 2 finger scroll--which is awesome!  I like it a lot.

 Now, this brings me back to Fedora.  I was still wanting to try this out, since I had only looked at Fedora 11 very briefly, and I had actually used Red Hat (pre-Fedora) for a while from 2000 to ~2002ish.   I have an Acer Aspire Revo (which I'd written specifically about before but that was wiped out from the other host crashing), I decided to install Fedora13 on here to dual-boot with Windows7.

 I first shrunk the Windows partition using [Gparted](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=gparted" target="_blank) which I installed onto the LiveUSB environment.  The install went very well, everything set up properly. I installed grub to the first sector of the /boot of Fedora, rather than to the MBR however, because of some issues I had read of involving Windows 7.  As I went to boot, it went straight to Windows without a hitch.  A problem, as I wanted to boot to Linux.  I then installed [EasyBCD](http://download.cnet.com/EasyBCD/3000-2094_4-10556865.html" target="_blank) onto WIndows and added Fedora to the boot menu.  After this, it has continued to work beautifully.

 I added [RPMFusion](http://rpmfusion.org/" target="_blank) repositories for any "Free" or "nonFree" content that is not included by default in the Fedora release.  I also used the [Unofficial Fedora FAQ](http://www.fedorafaq.org" target="_blank) to get flash working and some other things.

 I downloaded the latest [HeyBuddy](http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy" target="_blank) RPM from [PSquid's site](http://rpm.psquid.net/" target="_blank).  Now I am all up to date, and doing some further exploration into Fedora.  I am liking it, so far--and I really like the LXDE interface!  I don't know if I would switch from Arch...But if I was switching, this would be a contender (As would CrunchBang).

 Alright, That's all I've got!
