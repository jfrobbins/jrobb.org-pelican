[FreeBSD and the GPL](http://www.itpro.co.uk/620659/freebsd-and-the-gpl" target="_blank) -interesting article, although it gets a bit long.  I liked BSD when I tried it, however I was ust much more comfortable with Linux--if I had used and grown with BSD, I'm sure I could get comfortable with it, too.

 [Setting up a Linux server on a Windows network](http://www.itpro.co.uk/87709/setting-up-a-linux-server-on-a-windows-network" target="_blank) - hmmm...

 [Jolicloud: The Operating System Download for Netbook Youve Been  Looking For](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/jolicloud-operating-system-download-for-netbook/" target="_blank) - Jolicloud is great!  have it on my wife's eeePC

 [A bash primer](http://www.certcities.com/editorial/columns/story.asp?EditorialsID=408" target="_blank) - always good stuf to learn some bash
