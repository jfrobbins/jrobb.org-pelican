There are so many good [distributions](http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major), it is hard to settle on just one.
For me, anyway.

In the past when I've started [hopping](http://jrobb.org/tag/distrohop.html), I've almost always wound up using Fedora
or some debian-based distro like [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/). Then I go back and forth.

I've been using LM for quite some time now (Debian Edition on 2 PCs, LM17 on 2 PCs) and plus Ubuntu desktop on one laptop and Ubuntu Server on my VPS and home [server](http://jrobb.org/tag/server.html).
One of my LMDE PCs is a machine that I use at work to host Windows VMs for development, even though RHEL is the preferred deployment there. 

I am going to convert that work machine over to CentOS soon to be more company-compliant, and that got me started thinking that it'd be nice to play around with some more distros at home again.
I asked on [GNU Social](http://quitter.se/notice/2776190) and [Pump.io](https://io.jrobb.org/jrobb/note/svCSDr9QRGen0x6kcMmysw) for suggestions on distros to try, and got quite a few responses. 
I've condensed and edited the list, and will put a blurb for each here, plus my initial thoughts.

## On Free Software
I love [free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and I certainly _prefer_ to use it, however in my personal view it is not a requirement.
I will sacrifice freedom to have a working video or wifi driver (or even for one that works better). 
Other than hardware functionality, I don't care much about proprietary software and use free alternatives whenever possible.
Oh, except for [Steam](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_under_Linux), I like Steam.

Just so you know where I'm coming from here.

## The List:

* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)
    * I've used [Arch](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=arch) in the past for a while, and had a pretty good run. There's lots that I like (/love?) about it.
    * What I _don't_ like about it is possible instability due to its 'bleeding edge' nature.
* [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/)
    * [This](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=crunchbang) is another I have used in the past. 
    * It is great, but my main complaint is the same that I have for Debian stable and CentOS -- packages seem to get outdated very quickly.
* [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
    * [Debian](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=debian) is like the golden standard for GNU/Linux.
    * As noted above, my only complaint is that over time the packages get stale.
* [ElementaryOS](http://elementaryos.org/)
    * I don't know much about [this one](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=elementary), but it is apparently an Ubuntu derivative
    * It also looks focused on being pretty, which isn't a bad thing. Looks quite nice, though I don't know if it is for me.
* [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
    * [Fedora](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=fedora) is obviously a good option since it is very similar to CentOS/RHEL and compatibility is great as a convenience.
    * Downsides, I can't really think of any. Heavily company guided? That's about all I have.
* [kFreeBSD](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/)
    * This one is a port of Debian proper that makes use of the [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) kernel.
    * It looks to be still in development, but sounds interesting-- there is a "why" [on the wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD_why)
* [KaOS](http://kaosx.us/)
    * [This](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=kaos) one sounds interesting, it is [Arch](https://archlinux.org)-based and is rolling-release.
* [Mageia](http://www.mageia.org/)
    * [This](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=Mageia) is a fork of [Mandriva](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mandriva) which I've never used. 
    * Maybe I did use Mandrake once a long time ago, but I don't remember much about it.
* [Manjaro](http://manjaro.org/)
    * [This](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=manjaro) one looks pretty promising, being Arch-based!
* [Mepis](http://www.mepis.org/)
    * [Mepis](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=Mepis) looks ok, seems to be another Debian derivative using KDE.
* [Tanglu](http://tanglu.org/)
    * [Tanglu](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=Tanglu) looks and sounds good, is also Debian based.
* [Tiny Core linux](http://www.tinycorelinux.net/)
    * I don't see [this](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=tinycore) being a daily driver distro. I'll leave it here because it is useful, but I'm not going to seriously consider it.
* [Trisquel](http://trisquel.info/)
    * [Trisquel](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=trisquel) is an Ubuntu-based freedom-focused distro.
* [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.org/)
    * [This](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=xubuntu) one is a lightweight ubuntu.

At this very preliminary stage, I'd say my main contenders that I am biased towards are Fedora, Arch, Manjaro, and Tanglu.  I'm also very fascinated by the Debian/kFreeBSD.
I'll plan to install and try each one (in some order) for 2 weeks each, doing my normal activities.
I don't feel that I have a dificult list of needs to meet those daily activities which include:

* web browsing
* using [Dianara](https://gitorious.org/dianara/pages/Home) and [Pumpa](https://pumpa.branchable.com/) to interact with [Pump.io](https://pump.io)
* using [heybuddy](https://launchpad.net/heybuddy) to interact with GNU Social
* using Geany to do some code things (typically in python) and write text documents (like this blogpost)
* Email, most importantly of the GPG encrypted variety

OK, let's get started.
