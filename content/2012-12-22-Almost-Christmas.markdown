Apparently we survived the supposed [end of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon) with little ado.  Life goes on, and all of the crazy along with it.
So, I've basically forgotten that I have a blog...again.  Then again, I also thing blogs are rapidly going out of fashion in a big way--social media is the new "in" thing, though usually that limits your character count and formatting and other such things.  Blogs will still have some niche of space, if only for longer and more thought out replies or for more intense write-ups.

It is getting very close to Christmas, and I've spend the last few days being pretty sick.  Luckily I'm starting to feel a little better.

Now that I'm actually writing on this again (mainly because I'm a little bored, getting exhausted from being sick, and just plain love to type on my Das keyboard) I don't know if I'll keep this blog thing like this.  Jekyll is neat in practice, but seems like a lot of work.  
These days, I just want things to work, I don't want to have to fool around with fixing every bleeding thing every time I turn around.
I want my Linux desktop to just run (which is why I now run Linux Mint Debian), just like I want my car to run every day.  I want my website to be the same way, with as little interference from me as possible, I just want to add content whenever the mood strikes me.  Which obviously is pretty rarely.

I do like typing posts in nano (or vim), and the static content is awesome.  But then I have to generate it locally, and upload with scp and all that... just kind of a hassle.
Not really, but it seems that way to me right now.

I recently got a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), and I installed their default Raspbian distro on it...which I was greatly disappointed with.  It just didn't operate very smoothly.  I mean, of course it did good for such a small and cheap device, but I didn't like it.
I then tried out [Raspbmc](http://www.raspbmc.com/), which is absolutely fantastic.  It is very smooth, and it plays all of these files I have.  Except for the MPEG2 stuff, which you have to spend like $3 on a license for the capability to use hardware decoding, but still, not too bad. I use the Yatse remote on my android phone, and it's a blast in 1080p on my TV.
Actually, I had full-blown XBMC installed on an older PC of mine--dual core AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ with 8GB DDR2. I had just put a $50 video card in this thing, and it worked decently.  The raspberry pi works at LEAST as well as this PC, and probably better. Definitely more reliably.  That video card was a waste!

That's about all that's going on with me lately.  Work, work, sickly, gearing up for christmas.  At least I'm done with work until after the new year.
It's a much needed break, that's for sure.

Until next time.
