As I mentioned in my [fq blog post](http://factorq.net/2010/12/30/2010-is-coming-to-a-close/), 2010 is 
coming to an end.  Also, today is my son's birthday!  He turned 2 years old today, and for the next week or so, he 
and my daughter are the same age (then she turns 3, of course).

I'm updating this blog from my chair, on my laptop, trying to catch up on LinuxOutlaws podcasts which I am 
listening to on my Droid phone (I am still at least 10 episodes behind). I am using Putty for the ssh, since this 
thing has 
Windows7 on it and I am 
ssh-ing into my webserver to do this. Ah windows, yes, indeed.  The only reason this computer has windows is 
because it is my primary PC that I use for my job, and since it is work-provided it has Windows.  Although I do 
*really* like this laptop--it is an IBM/Lenovo X200. I think it is the perfect size for a laptop and functions 
very well--the next time I buy a laptop I think I will buy either one of these or something in the same form 
factor, albeit with some Linux OS. :-)

I have been bouncing back and forth trying to decide if I want to close down <a 
href="http://factorq.net">factorq.net</a>, or maybe not close down but something more like merge it with this 
website and convert the entire blog into this format.  This format of blog is very simple, hl-- consists of static 
html files that are served up with PHP. I'm typing up this blog entry with nano over the ssh, it's a very 
effective and just simple system.  One downside is the articles are just html text files that are named 
with numbers, they do not have any descriptive names or anything like that which kind of sucks.  Wordpress is 
great and has a lot of advantages, don't get me wrong, but I don't 
know, it just is overkill I think.  But like I said, I keep bouncing back and forth and can't really decide what I 
want to do.  Decisions!

I also want to test putting in hashtags into these posts. HL-- does not have "categories" or anything like that, 
but you CAN search posts. so if I have a tag in this post say... #life. I should be able to search for "#life" and 
this post and any other post that contains that should pop up.  Searching just for "life" may turn up a lot more 
than would be intended.

I should probably put the tags down at the bottom, so I will do that down below. I think I am done for now, I just 
wanted to type up a post here and test this out a bit, get a little use out of this website, anyway.

Happy New Year!

Jon
