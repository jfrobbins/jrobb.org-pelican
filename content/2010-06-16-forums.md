Summary: <h1>No More!</h1>


<h1>No More!</h1>
So, the forums have been disbanded until future notice (or until they are needed).  Try the [contact ](/contact)page!

 When they are reinstated, the URL will probably once again be http://fqforums.co.cc

 They still exist, I guess, at [http://fqnet.proboards.com/](http://fqnet.proboards.com/) but I do not check or maintain them these days.  The site isn't popular enough to justify it!
